  # PWA Text Editor - Challenge 19

  ## Description: 
  Our assignment was to create a progressive web app in the form of a text editor. The goal was to have the app store data in the cache and be downloadable to function offline with the saved data too. I am still working on the service worker connection and enabling offline functionality. Coming soon!

  ## Contributions
  I used starter code provided by our instructors as well as a great deal of code from class assignments, adjusted to suit this context. I also collaborated with the members of my study group: Matthew Bronstein, Jordan Harris, Leah Roman, and Joseph Ruiz on certain conceptual elements.
